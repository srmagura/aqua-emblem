<p>
    Aqua Emblem is a lot like Fire Emblem. Use F to select your units (blue) and move them around the map.
    Defeat the enemy army to beat the chapter. Click the button above to view the full Game Guide.

<ul class="how-to-play-list">
    <li><span class="defeat">You lose if ANY of your units die!</span></li>
    <li><span class="first-aid">Use Arrow's First Aid skill to heal your units!</span> 
        Units can even use healing skills on themselves unlike in Fire Emblem. 
        You'll get more healing skills as the game goes on.</li>

<h3>Supported browsers</h3> 
Aqua Emblem is tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. Mobile devices are not officially supported. The game probably works in Safari, but I don't test in Safari.

<h3>About</h3>
Aqua Emblem was developed by me: Sam Magura, <b>srmagura AT ncsu.edu</b>.
I originally planned for Aqua Emblem to be a 10 chapter game, but I had
only gotten to Chapter 3 when school started. So I decided to just release
what I had.

<p>Aqua Emblem is open source. Please email me if you have feedback, or
are interested in continuing the game's development. The code is online
at the <a href="https://github.com/srmagura/aqua-emblem">GitHub repository</a>.
