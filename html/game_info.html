<h3>Release notes for demo-v0.001</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Units gain experience in each battle. Once a unit builds up 100 exp, they level up.</li>
    <li>Trade items between units by choosing the "Trade" option from the action menu.</li>
    <li>Skills system. Choose "Skill" from the action menu to use a skill. There is
        only one skill right now (Defend), which everyone has. More skills will be added in the
        future. A "Skills" tab has also been added to the unit info window (which appears when you press S
        while the cursor is over a unit.)
    </li>
    <li>Using a skill takes a certain amount of MP. A unit regains 1 MP for every regular attack it lands.</li>
    <li>Status system. Units that have a special status are marked with an orange circle. Move the cursor to
    a unit to view its list of statuses. There is currently only one status, Defend, which signifies that a
    unit has used the Defend skill.</li>
    <li>Base stats and growth rates have been rebalanced. I'll continue to rebalance things as new skills,
    units, and chapters are added.</li>
    <li>Kenji has received cosmetic plastic surgery, becuz he was ugli before.</li>
