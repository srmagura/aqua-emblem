<p class="how-to-play">
    Aqua Emblem is a lot like Fire Emblem. Use F to select your units (blue) and move them around the map.
    Defeat the enemy army to beat the chapter. Click the button above to view the full Game Guide.

<ul class="how-to-play-list">
    <li><span class="defeat">You lose if ANY of your units die!</span></li>
    <li><span class="first-aid">Use Arrow's First Aid skill to heal your units!</span> 
        Units can even use healing skills on themselves unlike in Fire Emblem. 
        You'll get more healing skills as the game goes on.</li>
