    <h3>First steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the arrow keys to move the cursor (the purple box).</li>
        <li>While the cursor is over one of your units (blue), press F to select the unit. Then move 
        the cursor again to choose the unit's destination. Press F again to confirm the destination. 
        Press D to deselect the unit.
        <img src="images/game_guide/select.png" />
        </li>
        <li>Once you have chosen a destination, the action menu will appear. Use Up/Down and F to 
        choose an action, or press D to go back.
        <img src="images/game_guide/action_menu.png" /> 
        </li><li>
        Possible actions are:<br /><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Attack: Available when an enemy unit is in range.</li>
                <li>Skill: Use one of the unit's skills. Skills consume MP, but they have
                useful special effects. See the Skills section for more information.</li>
                <li>Trade: If you move next to one of your teammates, you can trade 
                items between the two units.</li>
                <li>Items: Opens the Items Menu. From this menu, you can equip weapons or
                discard items you don't want.</li>
                <li>Wait: Don't do anything. Ends this unit's turn.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Combat</h3>
    After choosing "Attack" from the Action Menu and choosing a weapon, moving the cursor over an enemy will show
    the Battle Stats Panel:
    <img src="images/game_guide/battle_stats_panel.png" />
    <p>Here's what the Battle Stats Panel tells you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Weapon triangle:</b> Swords beat axes, axes beats lances, and lances beat swords. A green up-arrow indicates that the unit
        has an advantage, while a red down-arrow indicates that the unit is at a disadvantage.</li>
        <li>HP: The unit's current HP.</li>
        <li>HIT: The percentage chance that the attack will hit.</li>
        <li>DMG: The amount of damage the attack will do if it hits. 
        If there is a <b>&times;2</b>, then the unit will attack twice.</li>
        <li>CRIT: The percentage chance of a critical hit. Critical hits do three times as much damage!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose "Skill" from the Action Menu to view the selected unit's skills. Then choose a skill and a unit to use it on.
        (Note: healing skills cannot be used on units that have full HP.)
        <img src="images/game_guide/use_skill.png" />
        </li> 
        <li>Using skills requires MP. Each time a unit lands a non-skill attack, 1 MP is restored.</li>
        <li>All units have the Defend skill, but other than that, most skills are unique.</li>
        <li>Upon levelling up, a unit may learn a new skill.</li>
        <li>Skills have types. Physical skills (sword, axe, lance, and bow) use the unit's Strength stat.
        The weapon triangle applies to skills too! Magic skills (holy and dark) use the unit's Magic stat.
        As with normal combat, holy magic has an advantage over dark magic.</li>
        <li>Some skills grant stat buffs or status conditions. Units with status conditions or stat changes
        are marked with an orange circle. The status conditions and stat changes are shown in the Unit Info 
        Box.

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Other useful controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Press E to open the End Turn menu. Press F to end your turn, or D to go back.
        <img src="images/game_guide/end_turn.png" /></li>
        <li>Press F while the cursor is over an enemy unit to view that unit's attack and
        movement ranges. Press D to go back.
        <img src="images/game_guide/enemy_range.png" /></li>
        <li>If you're impatient like me, press V to play the game at 3x speed. Pressing V again 
        will put the game back at normal speed.
